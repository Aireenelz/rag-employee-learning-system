How is team revenue calculated for Quarter 3?,"['• Final Total = Σ leg_times + (2 * n_products if direct_buyer).\nWhen is revenue / scores calculated?\nRevenue is calculated at the end of each quarter, not at the end of each month This means\nthat the monthly results only show the teams’ posi3oning and does not show the contracts\nwon or revenue won.

1. **Tenders Won**: The number of tenders your team has successfully secured during Quarter 3.
2. **Direct Buyers**: The revenue earned from Direct Buyers during Quarter 3. This is based on the number of products offered to Direct Buyers, as indicated by the revenue numbers associated with each Direct Buyer.
3. **Total Revenue**: This is the sum of the revenue from tenders won and the revenue from Direct Buyers.

The formula for calculating the Final Total (revenue) is:
\[ \text{Final Total} = \Sigma \text{leg\_times} + (2 \times n\_products \text{ if direct\_buyer}) \]

However, since revenue is calculated at the end of each quarter, the results for Quarter 3 will reflect the total contracts won and revenue earned during that quarter, rather than monthly results. 

In summary, for Quarter 3, you will add the revenue from tenders won and the revenue from Direct Buyers to determine the total revenue for that quarter.","Revenue is calculated by totaling the earnings from the North, East, and West regions.",0.5454545454545454,0.9940824699679187,0.0,0.0,,0.8232949401951535
