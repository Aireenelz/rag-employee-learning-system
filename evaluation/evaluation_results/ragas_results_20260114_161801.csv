3. **Resolve and Not Blame**: Focus on finding solutions rather than assigning blame. Approach the conflict with the intention of resolving the issue collaboratively.

4. **Intention to Build Others**: Approach the conversation with the goal of supporting and uplifting each other, rather than winning an argument. This mindset can lead to more constructive outcomes.

5. **See from Other's Perspective**: Try to empathize with the other person's situation. Understanding their feelings and motivations can help bridge gaps and foster a more open dialogue.
