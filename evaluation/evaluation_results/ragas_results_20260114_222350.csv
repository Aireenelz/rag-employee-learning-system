The program includes elements like:

1. **Strategic Thinking Simulation**: Participants engage in a simulation where they must strategize to meet revenue targets by securing contracts and gaining market share in a competitive environment.

2. **Realistic Goals**: The simulation sets clear objectives, such as selling products to buyers and managing operations over a specified number of operating days each month.

3. **Performance Monitoring**: Participants are tasked with monitoring employee performance during execution, providing feedback, and coaching for improvement, which reflects real managerial responsibilities.

4. **Dynamic Challenges**: The environment is designed to change, with new regions opening each quarter, requiring participants to adapt their strategies continuously.

5. **Collaboration and Competition**: Teams compete to deliver the most products to buyers, fostering collaboration and strategic planning among participants.

1. **Revenue Generation**: Direct Buyers allow teams to secure revenue without competition from other teams. This means that as long as a team offers products to a Direct Buyer, they will earn revenue based on the specific numbers associated with that buyer. For example, if a team offers 3 products to Buyer 1F, they will earn $6M, regardless of what other teams do.

2. **Permanent Product Assignment**: Once products are offered to Direct Buyers, they cannot be moved away. This means that the products remain with the Direct Buyer permanently, ensuring that the team retains the revenue associated with those products for the duration of the quarter.

3. **Impact on Revenue Calculation**: Revenue from Direct Buyers is included in the quarterly revenue calculations, which occur at the end of each quarter. This means that any products offered to Direct Buyers during the quarter will contribute to the team's revenue, but the actual revenue won will only be reflected in the quarterly results.

Overall, the Direct Buyer rule provides a stable revenue stream for teams and restricts the flexibility of product movement, as products once assigned to Direct Buyers cannot be reassigned.","Direct Buyers provide revenue regardless of competition; once products are offered to them, they cannot be moved away.",0.6428571428571429,0.9826326046814778,0.99999999995,1.0,,0.8749893545058232

4. **Multiple Buyers**:

5. **Eligibility to Upgrade**:

   - Products are not consumed during upgrades; they remain with the Buyer.

6. **Day Costs**:
