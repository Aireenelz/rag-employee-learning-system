By incorporating game-like dynamics and methods, gamification addresses the challenges of traditional training, which often struggles to maintain participant interest and engagement. 

Specifically, gamification:

1. **Heightens Interest**: It makes learning more enjoyable and engaging, encouraging active participation.
2. **Improves Retention**: The interactive nature of gamified training helps participants retain knowledge more effectively.
3. **Fosters Competition**: Gamification introduces elements of competition, which can motivate individuals and teams to perform better.
4. **Provides Immediate Feedback**: Participants receive instant feedback on their performance, which aids in learning and improvement.
5. **Encourages Habit Formation**: Through repeatable gameplay, learners can practice and reinforce their skills, leading to better habit formation.

Overall, gamification effectively targets the three critical factors of cognitive, competency, and confidence, creating a comprehensive training experience that drives sustainable behavior change and enhances business outcomes.","Gamification improves engagement in corporate training by adding enthusiasm and competition, thereby transforming the learning process into an exhilarating journey compared to traditional training methods.",0.9473684210526315,0.9941579962029535,0.9999999999666667,1.0,0.4126578217312851,0.9306312869251405

3. **Format**: BEWs can be offered fully digital or Face-To-Face, providing flexibility in how participants engage with the content.

4. **Focus on Learning Objectives**: BEWs are specifically targeted towards particular learning objectives that are pertinent to the organization, whereas full-fledged simulations may cover broader or more complex scenarios.

5. **Gamification**: While both BEWs and simulations may incorporate gamification, BEWs emphasize a competitive team-based approach with multiple iterated rounds, enhancing engagement and retention.

6. **Assessment**: BEWs include pre- and post-programme assessments to capture tangible improvements at both personal and project levels, which may differ in approach or execution from assessments used in full-fledged simulations.
